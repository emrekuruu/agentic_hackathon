I am currently starting a position as Student Researcher at the Microsoft, working on the Foundation Models and Robotics team, where I am building novel supervision approaches for multimodal foundation models with flow matching heads.

I built a framework and several packages within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab robotics simulation software for neural reconstruction and reinforcement learning for dexterous robotics, which are currently used by company Gravis Robotics and the Robotic Systems Lab.

I developed a novel, hard-to-translate dataset generation framework using optimization on large language reward models as part of a research project with Google Fellow Vilem Zouhar (currently aiming for publication).

During previous ML and Data Science internships, I worked on projects for S&P 500 customers, scaling training data pipelines to hundreds of gigabytes. Additionally, I worked as a Computer Vision Research Assistant prior to my studies at ETH."

It started with Stravesta, a vision for an AI-driven trading performance platform with setup scoring, behavior detection, and a personalized market scanner. I quickly realized: without clean, structured data, AI is worthless. So I built the data foundation first:

Entrio (https://www.entrio.cloud/), an AI trading journal, currently in invite-only beta. Traders upload screenshots, OpenAI Vision (gpt-4.1) auto-extracts trade data (symbol, direction, SL/TP, timeframe). Includes an AI Trade Coach (GPT-4.1, 200-trade context), AI-generated weekly reports, psychology tracking with emotional shift analysis, Stripe billing, 7-language i18n, and a full Chrome Extension with Side Panel for in-browser trade capture. PWA-enabled.

ExtensionReach, an internal LinkedIn outreach tool I built for my own beta tester acquisition. Features a 10-stage lead pipeline, automated lead discovery (LinkedIn API, Reddit, TradingView, Substack, Medium), Perplexity web research per lead, AI draft generation, and a Chrome Extension for LinkedIn DOM automation. Currently building two AI agents on top: Claudia (outreach intelligence) and Ale (content manager).

Everything connected through Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, RLS, Realtime) and hosted on Vercel. Currently part of the AWS Startup Program and Supabase Startup Program."
